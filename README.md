Restores the "1." to the start of the Minecraft Client version number.

Self explanatory.

## NOTE: Until builds start being tagged without the "1.", you will end up with duplicate "1." in your version naming. The current build will show "1.1.21.10" or "1.1.21.11", but when, for example, "26.0.0" rolls around, it will be "1.26.0.0".
